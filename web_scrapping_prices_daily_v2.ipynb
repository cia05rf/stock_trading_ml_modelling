    "2. open pipe to h5 file holding current price data.\n",
    "3. Loop though the tickers and for each one; \n",
    "    1. find the most recent price date.\n",
    "    2. convert this into a time stamp to be used on Yahoo finance.\n",
    "    3. go to Yahoo Finance and get all the prices between the last time stamp and the current timestamp.\n",
    "4. Add these new prices to the h5 file.\n",
